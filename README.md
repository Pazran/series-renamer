# Series Renamer

I made this script for personal use. Nothing special.

**Scenario**

I download Dragon Ball Super and put it in folder but ever damn time the name formatting is off. Some name contain website and i hate copy paste the name from the old episode especially if i download bunch of episodes and did not rename it. So some might say "You lazy bastard". :smile:

**Details**

This script using the batch functionality and send to in windows inspired by [subtitle-downloader](https://github.com/manojmj92/subtitle-downloader).
If anyone want to use this for other series you have to change the title in the *renamer.py* and few lines (read the comments in the file)

How to make it work:
- Open exploere.exe type *shell:sendto*
- Copy and past the *renamer.cmd* here
- Put *renamer.py* in *D:\\*

Now just right click the file > Send To > renamer.cmd (*Note: do it in order from episode 1 to final episode*)

**Notes**

If anyone have better suggestion feel free to edit.
